This shall be put into a standalone script later.

Install Docker

run : docker pull neilkakkar/prisma:full
# This will be changed to the official Prisma hub. This has been built via prisma-core/docker/base/Dockerfile

For each node instance,
run : docker run -it -p 5000:8000 neilkakkar/prisma:full
# Here, 5000 is the port on localhost that maps to listen port, 8000 on the node terminal
# Hence, in the bootstrap config, prisma.ini, write "127.0.0.1:5000"
