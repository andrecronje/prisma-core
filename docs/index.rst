What is Prisma?
---------------
Prisma is the first open source, distributed ledger cryptocurrency based on Swirld's Hashgraph consensus algorithm. Prisma is fast, fair, efficient, decentralized, and fault tolerant. Prisma is the next generation Cryptocurrency.

Whats different from blockchains?
---------------------------------
Instead of limiting the speed and forming blocks relying on a 51% consensus, every transaction in a cryptograph instantly starts spreading through the network, as long as 2/3 of the nodes agree with the transaction it is accepted. Every transaction is technically a fork, and there is no blockheight, instead there is a newest and oldest timestamped transactions. The algorithm itself verifies transactions, so there is no Proof of Work or Proof of Stake need. Instead of saving every transaction, once the network agrees on a "Signed State" (newest order of transactions and amounts of accounts) all the old transactions can be deleted, significantly saving space, and allowing new nodes to join faster. Prisma is so efficient it can be run on a smartphone, which allows for 100% decentralization, no special hardware required, everyones equal.

What makes it better
--------------------
Its obvious blockchains, and Proof of Work are really good at some things, when you need to store information forever, or possibly use the Proof of Work for calculations. As far as currency usually those things are not needed to run on a whole network, Swirld's Cryptograph consensus eliminates all of unnecessary functions and work most cryptocurrency's use. Prisma will bring the most basic form of a cryptocurrency and have ultra fast, ultra efficient, and ultra decentralized platform without the overhead.

Fault Tolerance
---------------
In a blockchain, you wait for confirmations. This is because the network remains unsure, and with every confirmation, it becomes slightly more sure. In our algorithm your transaction gets verified as soon 2/3 of the nodes in the network verify its legitimate. This makes transactions much faster. The network will work work even 1/3 of the nodes are dishonest.

Fair
----
We've all waited an hour for a Bitcoin transaction to process. All transactions in Prisma are processed in the order they propagate through the network. The biggest advantage anyone can have is a faster, more connected network. Also a node can be run on almost any device, and takes no special hardware.

Fast
----
The cryptograph speed is only limited by bandwidth, this enables thousands of
transactions per second, so an average connection of only a few MB/s
would be sufficient for near instant transactions.

Roadmap
-------
Our plan is to extend the platform onto cellular devices, having the cellphone act as a full temporary node while a payment occurs not involving any third party wallet gateway. Also a NFC payment solution will be offered, this will make it easy for 2 party's to make payments using a cellular device. Also a multi-signature wallets from cellular devices will be proposed. This means full decentralization. The future usage of Prisma also demands development in a more performance efficient language. We will therefore develop a Rust version with the help of the reference implementation.
